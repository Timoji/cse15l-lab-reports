# Week 7 Lab Report
## Part 1
### Changing the name of the start parameter and its uses to base. <br/>
**Keys pressed during this operation:** /start< Enter >cebase< Esc >n.n. <br/>
- /start <br/>
- < Enter > <br/>
![find start](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456651-bac784e6-894e-4c11-ab82-3883ad4f5435.PNG) <br/>

The / command search for whatever words/characters are added after it. In this photo, it is search for the word start. <br/>
Pressing < Enter > after searching will save/remember the searched term. <br/>

- c <br/>
- e <br/>
![ce cmds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456692-a3fa6c0c-4b97-47ed-a0ce-54915ba76ba3.PNG)

The c command means change and the e command will change and delete up until the end of the word that the cursor is on. <br/>
This will also put vim into insert mode. <br/>

- base <br/>
- < Esc > <br/>
![base cmd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456783-1a1ddb59-16d0-4a28-9c1c-3cbc2e18d6c4.PNG)

After deleting the word and going into insert mode, you can change the word start to base. Then the < Esc > will <br/>
exit out of insert mode and go back to normal mode. <br/>

- n <br/>
![n cmd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456802-b86917f0-7007-4eeb-9275-9de29a893faf.PNG)

Since we saved the searched term by pressing < Enter > after searching. We can now use the n command to go to the <br/>
next searched term. <br/>

- . <br/>
![period cmd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456814-116af527-555b-4d5b-bee9-ea6af814b782.PNG)

The . command will repeat the last edit that you have done to the word that the cursor is on. <br/>

- n <br/>
![n cmd2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456828-89609eeb-adf0-479e-8199-41764b2b9dbf.PNG)

This will go to the next searched term. <br/>

- . <br/>
![period cmd2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114313685/201456835-20d6e8dd-2f89-47d3-a20d-4ede6aeba5af.PNG)

This will repeat the last edit. <br/>

## Part 2
When trying to do the edit above locally, it took around 40 seconds to do. <br/>
When trying to do the edit above remotely, it took around 20 seconds to do. <br/> <br/>

- Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why? <br/>
If running remotely, I would prefer to use vim when trying to edit files because there are a lot of helpful shortcuts that <br/>
vim offers. For example the . command is very helpful and can greatly reduce the time wasted on typing the same thing over <br/>
and over again. <br/> <br/>

- What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? <br/>
If the project or task requires for me to make a new program then I would prefer to work locally because it is easier to <br/>
use my mouse when working with a whole program. If the task is to edit a tiny bit of the code or fix a minor error in a <br/>
code then I would prefer vim because it is more convenient.
